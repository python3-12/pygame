Detecting clicks, key presses,
and mouse movements:

In Pygame to detect if a mouse moved, you can use pygame.MOUSEMOTION events. 
To detect key presses check for pygame.KEY DOWN events. 
To detect when you let go of the key, use pygame.KEY UP events.
To detect when you click the x at the top right corner, use the pygame.event.QUIT event.
